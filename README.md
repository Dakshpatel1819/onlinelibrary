# Phase 2 - Library Project: Getting the Look and Around

Hey! This part of the project was all about making the library website look good and letting you click around.

**What's Done:**

* **Moving Between Pages:** You can now click links to go to the homepage, see all the books, and check out details for each book.
* **Basic Layout:** The pages have a basic structure with a header, main content, and a footer.
* **Some Style:** It's not super fancy yet, but there's some styling to make it easier to look at (colors, spacing).
* **Book List Display:** You can see a list of books on the "Books" page.
* **Book Details:** When you click a book, you get a page with more info (just basic stuff for now).
* **(Kind of) Ready for Real Data:** We've set things up so it *could* grab real book info from somewhere later. For now, it's just using fake book data.

**How to See It:**

1.  Make sure you have the stuff to run it (Node.js and npm).
2.  Open the project in your computer's terminal.
3.  Type `npm install` to get everything it needs.
4.  Then type `npm run dev` to start it up.
5.  Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

**What's Next:**

Phase 3 will be about making it actually *do* things, like letting you borrow or reserve books using real data!
