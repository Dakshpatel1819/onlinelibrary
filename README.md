Online Library Application - 

Phase 1: Foundation
 Welcome to Phase 1 Foundation of the Online Library Application! This phase 
kicks off the project by setting up the core structure for a web-based platform to 
explore books. Built with Next.js, it establishes the groundwork for a user-friendly 
book discovery app. 

 🎯 Objective - Create the basic structure and core components for a web-based library app, enabling navigation and book display.

 🔑 Key Features
- 🧭Basic Navigation Seamless movement across app sections via a navbar.
- 📖Core Components Navbar, BookList, and BookItem to display book data.
- ⚙State Management Initial setup for dynamic content handling.

🛠 How It Works
- Users land on the homepage with a simple layout.
- Navbar links to the homepage and placeholder sections.
- BookList shows static book data (e.g., title, author) for testing.

📋 Development Process
- Planning: Defined project folder structure and component hierarchy.
- Designing: Sketched initial wireframes for homepage and navigation.
- Development: Built Navbar, BookList, and BookItem components; set up basic routing with Next.js.
- Testing: Verified navigation and component rendering on desktop and mobile.

 💻 Technologies Used
- Next.js: React framework for project setup.
- React: Component development and state management.
- CSS Modules: Basic styling for components.
- Git/GitHub: Version control for tracking changes.
  
 ⚠️ Challenges Faced
 - Challenge: Configuring Next.js routing was tricky due to limited experience.
    - Solution: Watched Next.js tutorials and implemented  next/link for client-side navigation.
 
- Challenge: Component rendering varied across browsers.
   - Solution: Added CSS resets and tested on Chrome and Firefox.
 🧠What I Learned
- Got comfortable with Next.js project setup and routing.
- Learned the importance of modular components for scalability.
- Gained confidence in starting a web project from scratch.

🚀Future Scope
- Add dynamic data fetching with an API.
- Enhance UI with responsive and polished styling.
- Expand navigation to include search and book details pages.
